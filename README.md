# John Conway's the Game of Life

This is basic cellular automata at it's finest. If you're unfamiliar with cellular automata or John Conway I recommend
googling the interweb. The wiki is a good place to start: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

The purpose of this app is to have an open source version for android for those that are interested in the game, or just 
want to test out and develop their coding skills by adding features or changing things. The app is available on Google Play 
and credit for any contributions will be added in the app itself under Attributions.

Note -> please don't make clones and launch them on the playstore. There's already a gazillion versions of game of life on there.
No need to add more. Also note, one of the images requires permission before distributing -> the microbial handprint.
