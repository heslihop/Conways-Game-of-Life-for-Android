# John Conway's the Game of Life

This is basic cellular automata at it's finest. i.e. It's living cells simulated using a few simple survival rules.

1. If a cell has less than 2 neighbours, it dies of loneliness.
2. If a cell has more than 3 neighbours it dies of overcrowding.
3. If an empty space has exactly 3 neighbours, in the next generation a new cell is born there.

Normally the world is initially with random cells and they evolve from there. If you're unfamiliar with cellular automata or John Conway I recommend googling the interweb. The wiki is a good place to start: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

The purpose of this app is to have an open source version for android for those that are interested in the game, or just 
want to test out and develop their coding skills by adding features or changing things. The app is available on Google Play (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heslihop.wesley.gameoflife&rdid=com.heslihop.wesley.gameoflife">Link</a>)
and credit for any contributions made by you will be added to the app itself under Attributions.
